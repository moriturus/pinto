# demos — feature coverage datasets

This directory contains ready-to-use local boards for trying pinto features. All data is plain
text (Markdown and TOML) and can be edited freely.

Run commands from each demo directory through the repository binary:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path ../../../Cargo.toml -- <args>       # for example: ... -- board
```
